# Kinship Care Information – Crawford County JFS

## Definition

Kinship Care as a temporary or permanent arrangement in which a relative or any non-relative adult who has a long-standing relationship or bond with the child and/or family, has taken over the full-time, substitute care of a child.

The arrangement represents the most desirable out-of-home placement option, offering stability while allowing children to maintain their cultural identity and family connections.

## Kinship Permanency Incentive Program

### Eligibility Requirements
- Legal custody or guardianship obtained on or after July 1, 2005
